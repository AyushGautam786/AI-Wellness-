One morning, he accidentally knocked over his water jar, and as he rushed to clean it, his hand brushed against a forgotten palette of vibrant colors. Without thinking, he dipped his brush in yellow and added a single stroke to his gray canvas. That stroke became a sun, then rays of light, then an entire field of sunflowers.

That winter, Ahmed began to notice the intricate patterns of frost, the way snow outlined every branch, the quiet beauty of the season.

Her mother found her gathering the pieces, tears streaming. 'Let me show you something,' her mother said gently. Together, they arranged the fragments into a beautiful mosaic, filling the gaps with gold paint. 'In Japan, they call this kintsugi,' her mother explained. 'The breaks become part of the beauty.'
