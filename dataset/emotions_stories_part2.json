Jordan's was wild and free, with flowers spilling over paths and vegetables growing wherever they pleased. They often looked over the fence, each thinking the other's garden was better. One day, a storm damaged both gardens. Working together to clean up, they realized something beautiful: Alex's precision had created the perfect framework for Jordan's wild creativity, while Jordan's abundance had inspired Alex to let beauty grow beyond boundaries. They decided to remove the fence. Their combined garden became more magnificent than either had been alone.",

Her reflection looked back at her, and she noticed how harsh her internal voice became when facing herself. She began speaking to her reflection as she would to her dearest friend - with kindness, encouragement, and forgiveness. Slowly, the critical voice softened. She realized that she had been a faithful friend to everyone except the person who needed her love most: herself.

'Grandpa,' she said, 'these hands still do important things.' She took his weathered hands in hers. 'They still hug me, still turn pages when you read to me, still hold Grandma's hand during movies.'

He sat quietly nearby while she ate, walked at her pace, celebrated tiny moments of trust. After months, Luna finally rested her head on his knee.

Hours later, came the reply: 'Same stars, different sky. Still connected.' They began sharing photos of the same constellations from their different continents.
